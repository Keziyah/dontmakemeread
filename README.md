Resources for learning about revolutionary topics without reading long texts

## Don't Make Me Read About Abolition
### Why I’m making this: 

![jared, 19, doesn't know how to read](https://images.app.goo.gl/2EPKFoTMG8rqcgLi7)

Hi, I’m Keziyah, I’m 30, and I DID learn how to fucking read, but I don’t particularly enjoy it. 

Reading is just one of many ways to consume information. I personally don’t have the attention span for reading large texts and I’m sure there are many other people in the same boat. That doesn’t mean we aren’t intelligent, or that we don’t want to learn, or that we can’t learn. We just don’t like the whole moving your eyes across a page/screen over and over again thing. (It gives me a headache). And that’s ok!

If you give me a list of books to read, keeping it 2 virgils, I ain’t reading them. I’ve saved PDFs to my computer and made lists of free books online before. It’s not that I don’t want to. It’s just that I’m not a fan of reading with my eyes for long periods of time. I made this list mostly for myself so that I can learn about this issue. Just because I don’t want to read, doesn’t mean I don’t want to learn. 

**Don’t Make Me Read About Abolition is a list of resources, including fundamental texts, on police and prison abolition, that are NOT printed books.** So: audiobooks, zines, videos, podcasts, etc. 

Feel free to make your own Don’t Make Me Read About… on a revolutionary topic of your choice. 

Some tips: 
- You’re not going to learn everything today, this week, or this year. Take your time and don’t feel bad about not being an expert.
- I couldn’t find free audiobooks for everything. See if your local library has it
- If you can’t find time to listen to books, try listening while you do other things: going for a walk, taking a shower, doing the dishes, cleaning your room, commuting, working out, etc. 

**Finally, I am NOT an expert in ANY of these things, and I am making my way through this list myself.** These recommendations come from people and organizations who know more about these things than I do. For example, this list, and this thread. (Definitely check those out.) If you have any suggestions let me know, but **don’t expect this list to be perfect, or complete.**

As of today (7 June 2020) I have added some core texts accompanied by video interviews and lectures. I plan on adding more things soon. 

#### How you can help: 
Soon I’ll post info on how to contribute here on GitHub. I’d like to add: fundamental shorter texts/articles, podcasts, documentaries, videos of other kinds, infographics, etc.
